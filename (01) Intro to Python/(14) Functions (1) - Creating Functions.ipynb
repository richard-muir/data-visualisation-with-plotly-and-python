    "In this lesson we're going to learn about functions in Python. Functions are an important tool when programming and their use can be very complex. It's not the aim of this course to teach you how to implement functional programming, instead, this lesson will give you a grounding in how functions work and an insight into how we can use them to help us create charts with Plotly.\n",

    "## What is a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code which is used to perform a single action. A function should be reusable, and it should behave predictably. We have already used several built-in functions, such as <code>print()</code> and <code>len()</code>, but Python also allows you to create user-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to create a function\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of creating a function is relatively straightforward. We first need to tell Python that we're going to define a function using the <code>def</code> keyword; we must then give the function a name followed by some parentheses (<code> () </code>) and a colon. Function names have the same restrictions as variable names (can't start with a number, can only contain letters, numbers and underscores). After the function name has been defined, any code within the function is indented by four spaces (or a tab):\n",
