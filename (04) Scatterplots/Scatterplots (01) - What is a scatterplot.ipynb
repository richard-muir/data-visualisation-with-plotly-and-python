    "#### Scatterplots generally show two types of relationships:\n",
    "1. The relationship between a control or independent variable (plotted on the x-axis), with the dependent variable of interest plotted on the y-axis. For example a researcher may hypothesise that the selling price of a house is related to the floor space. The selling price is the variable of interest and is plotted on the y-axis, whlst the area is the independent variable and is plotted on the x-axis. <a href =\"https://plot.ly/~bturnbull/106/california-housing-prices-and-size-scatter-plot/\">This plot</a> by the Plotly user <a href=\"https://plot.ly/~bturnbull\">@bturnbull</a> is a great example: \n",
    "<img src=\"https://plot.ly/~bturnbull/106/california-housing-prices-and-size-scatter-plot.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The relationship between two variables, neither of which is assumed to be dependent on the other. A famous example of this comes from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set\">Iris flower dataset</a> which is used as a test case for machine learning algorithms. <a href=\"https://plot.ly/~akandykeller/836/sepal-width-vs-petal-length.embed\">This plot</a> by Plotly user <a href=\"https://plot.ly/~akandykeller/folder/home\">@akandykeller</a> shows the relationship between two different kinds of petal for two subspecies of the same plant. Neither measurement can be thought to cause the other, but the relationship between the two, or the correlation, is interesting:\n",
